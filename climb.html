            <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">context</span></h4>

            <div class="subheader">What is the problem we are trying to solve?</div>

            The e-sports market is growing by day. League of Legends alone has had nearly $30 million USD in prize money as of 2016.  Professional teams value precise analytical data beyond what the eye can capture by just rewatching the game. <br/><br/>

            We want to harness large amounts of game data to create insights that people would not normally be able to view.  On top of that, we want to create a platform that allows analysts, coaches, players to easily review their notes and the insights/events drawn from each game.

            <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">my role</span></h4>

            Climb is one of those rare projects where I get to wear all sorts of hats and stretch beyond my comfort zone.  I get to explore so many different realms of design, while touching on the worlds of product, business, and tech:
            <ul class="takeaways">
              <li><b>Product Design</b>: Creatively solving a problem with a well-designed solution and making the decisions that affect not only the design, but also the product</li>
              <li><b>Visual Design</b>: Logos, color schemes, typography, style guides</li>
              <li><b>User Interface Design</b>: The core of the product is the dashboard interface that users interact with, so the way information is displayed (information architecture, white space, consistency, etc.) is so very important</li>
              <li><b>User Experience Design</b>: Creating an intuitive flow and easy-to-navigate experience is a huge part of the team's iterations</li>
              <li><b>User Research</b>: Exploring and understanding what user-driven really means and how it affects design decisions</li>
            </ul>

        <div data-aos="fade-up" >

            <!-- <div class="subheader">Competitive analysis</div>

            Coming soon. -->

            <div class="subheader">Metrics</div>

            Important metrics to keep in mind throughout the process may be things such as the amount of time needed to review a game and depth of analysis (if you're only tracking deaths and play styles or can you also address things like pathing and gold allocation).

            <div class="subheader">Game Details Page</div>

            The game details page refers to the dashboard that displays the game mini-map, player and team information, and event tracking.  This is the core feature that Climb offers, combing the ease-of-use of the interface with the analytics and machine learning that the back-end offers.


            <div class="subheader">Home Page</div>

            The home page will display the recently watched games, allowing users to jump back into a game they might have left off at before, the recent matches their team has played, as well as an intuitive search (basic and advanced) to filter for a particular game.<br/><br/>

            This simplistic structure allows users to easily organize their games, review their notes, and put resources and time into improving gameplay rather than searching for games, downloading VODs, and importing data on their own.

            <div class="subheader">Style Guide</div>

          </div>
          <div class="bigimg">

            <img src="climb/styleguide.png" width="100%"/>
          </div>



          <div class="container-dark">

            While developing this style guide, I kept in mind the importance of not only designing for the aesthetics, but also for functionality, consistency, and usability. <br/><br/>

            Consistency within the app is important, along with consistency with the League of Legends community.  Picking a deep blue-gray base color relates the product to League of Legends.  Gold allows users to associate a victorious color, and success, with using Climb.  I chose to keep the palette relatively muted given the dashboard itself containing several other elements that draws color attention - the map, the champion icons, the player stats, etc.  Staying neutral and muted reduces detracting the user's attention from the gameplay and performance.<br/><br/>

            When choosing fonts, I wanted to stick with rounded edged fonts, while maintaining readability.  It was important to choose fonts that would be very easy to read on a dark background and at different sizes.

            <div class="subheader">Wireframing</div>


          </div>
          <div class="bigimg">
<img src="climb/lofi.png" width="100%"/><br/><br/>
            <img src="climb/sketches.png" width="100%"/>
          </div>



          <div class="container-dark">

            <img src="climb/mockup1.png" width="100%"/><br/><br/>


                One of our first ideas was implementing a double collapsing menu.  One menu leads to other parts of the app, and the secnod is a game detail menu of the current game being viewed.  The basic elements necessary are a mini-map, video player timeline, stats of players on both sides, and the ability to add and view events.
                <br/><br/>
                <div class="subsub"><span>Problems:</span></div>
                The double collapsing menu takes up a lot of screen real estate, thus forcing the mini-map smaller.  Game details force the user to view the events vertically (from up to down), while the natural process of chronological events is left to right.  In addition, having the existing events stacked on top of the "create new event" function creates a problem of possible forcing the "create new event" too far down.  Users should not have to scroll to access a vital feature.



<br/><br/>
            <img src="climb/mockup2.png" width="100%"/><br/><br/>

            I spent some time exploring other options such as having tabbed menus rather than the double collapsing menu.  This iteration was spent primarily on playing with colors.
            <br/><br/>
            <div class="subsub"><span>Problems:</span></div>
            Lack of clarity on what the menus are, on top of all of the aforementioned problems from the first cycle.



          <br/><br/>

            <img src="climb/mockup3.png" width="100%"/><br/><br/>

            This iteration was spent on fleshing out the design and developing the style guide.  Colors for the two teams (red and blue side) are drawn from the original League of Legends interface.  The background is made darker to allow the eye to focus on the mini-map.  I try incorporating icons for more indentification on what each menu is.
            <br/><br/>
            <div class="subsub"><span>Problems:</span></div>
          Use of sans-serif and serif fonts is confusing and distracting.  I needed to figure out a way to better use the combination, or scrap it altogether.  Most of the aforementioned problems are still not addressed in this cycle.


          <br/><br/>


            <img src="climb/mockup4.png" width="100%"/><br/><br/>

            This iteration is really when I start tackling those original design problems.  I explore a solution of having a tag carousel (or event carousel) of the events that have been created.  This allows the users to follow the chronological events from left to right along with the video timeline.  A more clarified system is designed for the team display on top - more readability for gold, kills, and towers.
            <br/><br/>
            <div class="subsub"><span>Problems:</span></div>
          Having a carousel and a video timeline and the sidebar makes the entire app feel very cluttered.  We want to make Climb as minimal as possible, and focus on the map and player display.  The video timeline and the event carousel also feels excessively overlapping, since both display time-based information.


          <br/><br/>



            <img src="climb/mockup5.png" width="100%"/><br/><br/>

            We got rid of the main menu sidebar altogether, leaving only the logo to have users return to the home page.  The other big decision was to combine the event carousel and the video timeline.  Events are displayed as circles, and users can hover over the events to view the tiel.  This allows much more room for the mini-map.
            <br/><br/>
            <div class="subsub"><span>Problems:</span></div>
          We need to explore how to display all of the notes taken for each particular game without having the user click on each individual event to view those notes.  Perhaps there can be a fixed notes section built into the design.


          <br/><br/>

            <img src="climb/mockup6.png" width="100%"/><br/><br/>

            I decided to go with version C, which provides the most clarity while still remaining simplistic.

            <div class="subheader">Next Steps</div>
            There is still a lot of work being done and to be done.  Immediate next design steps include building out different versions of the logo (someday that golden temporary C will be replaced by a real logo!), thinking about how to display graph view alongside the map view, exploring a fixed notes option, and researching better ways to allow the user to intake information, without having to view all the different data being displayed across the dashboard at all times.

            <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">Results & Takeaways</span></h4>

          Though this project is still in progress, I have already learned and gained so much.  Just by being in a position where I am forced to take on different roles, explore different realms of design, I am able to flex my skills and learn new ones that I have never touched on before.  <br/><br/>

          Working alongside engineers and product managers is something I will be doing for hte rest of my life, and this project gave me really good insight on how that collaboration works.  Learning how to really speak the language of developers, how they view a problem versus how a designer approaches it, and how to present a solution that fits the product's needs as well as the developer's viewpoints.
