                <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">context</span></h4>

              "The Blizzard Mobile team is partnering with the game team developing World of Warcraft. The World of Warcraft Armory app was originally launched in July 2009 and the time has come to <b>give the app renewed focus and modernize the experience</b>. As a player favorite, we have decided to release an <b>Auction House focused app that offers a delightful and streamlined version of the current experience</b>. <br/><br/>

              Deliver a design brief that includes your research and approach supported by interaction flows or a design prototype that demonstrates the newly streamlined core functions of the new Auction House app. You may choose to focus on the iOS or Android version."<br/><br/>

              <ul class="takeaways">
                <li>Outline necessary research and design process</li>
                <li>Provide UX deliverables to communicate your research and solution</li>
                <li>You may include other artifacts such as personas, visual designs or working sketches to support your decisions but they are not required</li>
                <li>Describe what methods you would ideally use to validate your design decisions.</li>
              </ul>

                <div class="blockquote"><b>Goal</b>: Design a solution to tackle WoW's complex Auction House, that streamlines from the existing app, while creating a newer, more modern experience.</div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div data-aos="fade-up" >

              <div class="container-dark">

                <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">my role</span></h4>
                  As this was an individual design test, I took in hand all parts of the designing, research, and decision making.

                <div class="subheader">background research</div>

                As I am not a big World of Warcraft player (in fact, I only have vague memories playing the free trial of the game up till level 20 in middle school), I decided I needed a better understanding of the game, the community, and what role the Auction House plays throughout it all. <br/><br/>

                WoW is a very complex game, with many years of history and changes.  Everything ideated and created throughout this process can only be surface level due to the time and scope of the project.<br/><br/>

                I began my research by downloading and playing the game.  Unfortunately, a free account doesn't allow the user to explore much of the Auction House, but I continued my exploration via the web-based Auction House, the existing mobile Auction House, and third party sites that players used for the Auction House.  I spent a good amount of time familiarizing myself with the existing platforms.  I wanted to note <b>Auction House flow</b>, <b>user interaction animations</b>, and <b>design standardization</b>.<br/><br/>

                <div class="subheader">What is the Auction House?</div>
                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li>A portal that allows players to buy and sell from other players</li>
                  <li>Items range from weapons, armor, recipes, drops, etc.</li>
                  <li>Serves as an important money-sink in the game - a game mechanic that helps control the inflation rate and in-game economy, allowing devs to introduce money and remove excess money from the economy as necessary</li>
                  <li>Each faction (2) has its own AH, and they share a neutral one</li>
                  <li>Alliance-linked and Horde-linked Auction Houses now exist as well</li>
                  <li>Each capital city has its own AH</li>
                  <li>Remote AHs exist on the web platform and the Armory app; Remote AHs limit transactions to 200 per day</li>
                  <li>Auction Houses serve as a connection portal for players to sell and buy goods from various different platforms to various audiences</li>

                </ul>


                <div class="subheader">Standardization of the look and feel</div>
                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li><b>Standardization of tabs</b>:  The set, present 4 tabs are Buy, Sell, Bids, and Auction.  In-game seems to have 3 set tabs (Browse, Bids, and Auctions), with some variation in other tabs.</li>
                  <li><b>Login</b>: Standardizing with Battle.net (overall Blizzard look - blue, dark, clean) vs. WoW look</li>
                  <li><b>Animation</b>: Page turning of the existing Armory app</li>
                  <li><b>Search and Display</b>: Ensuring information that is displayed for each item is standardized, as well as the sort/search/filter options.</li>
                </ul>


                <div class="subheader">Questions</div>
                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li><b>What is the distinction between updating the look and feel from something that is too outdated versus updating it to the point where it is beyond the look and feel of WoW?</b>  From a third party perspective, it seems as there is a fine line between updating the mobile app or creating a new app that is WoW related to be very sleek and modern (design-wise), while still keeping it in the realms of World Of Warcraft's game feel, which gives a feel of worn, grunge, and fantasy. </li>

                </ul>


                <div class="subheader">User feedback on current auction house</div>
                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li>Bid pages filled with single item posts, forcing users to scroll through hundreds of pages looking for stacks.  This results in slow servers, long wait times, and encourages botting.</li>
                  <li>Users want option to filter auction listings for buyout only. </li>
                  <li>Users want the option to sell/buy certain number of items within a stack.  In other words, perhaps scrapping stacks altogether, and just post number of availablity for a certain item, then buyers can buy however many they want of that total number.  Leftover items remain on the market.</li>
                  <li>Users rely on add-ons for the auction house to increase accuracy and speed of buyout items.</li>
                </ul>

            Before defining features, I want to return to the given prompt, background information, and goals for this app.

            <ul class="takeaways">
              <li><b>Give the app renewed focus, with a modernized experience.</b>  Improved flow and intuitiveness, imrpoved visual design.  Simplicity and user-centricity is key.</li>
              <li><b>Delightful and streamlined version of the current experience.</b> Features should remain consistent with existing auction houses (across platforms), with improvements that would eventually need to reach all platforms.  Look and feel should match WoW's existing design standards.</li>
            </ul>


            <div class="subheader">Scope and Constraints</div>
            <ul class="takeaways">
              <li>Lack of experience with the game.</li>
              <li>Lack of access to the full game features.</li>
              <li>The scope is unclear due to my lack of full knowledge.  In addition, there is haziness in a modernized design vs. maintaining the look and feel of WoW's less modern look.  There is also haziness in extent of the redesign - for example, customer support, advanced and new features, etc.</li>
              <li><b>What I will address</b>: improve flow and intuitiveness, lessen steps needed to complete certain actions</li>
                <li><b>What I will not address</b>: altering core features, visual design</li>
            </ul>

                <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">Wrapping Up</span></h4>

                <div class="subheader">Validating Design Decisions</div>
                If given the opportunity to, what would be the steps I would take to validate my design decisions?
                <ul class="takeaways">

                  <li><b>Cross-department collaboration</b>: [Before designing] Designers, engineers, support, etc. all have different exposure and insight to the product and the problem at hand.  A brainstorming session allows many ideas to be brought to the table and a better determination on what is important and what is not.</li>

                  <li><b>Concept testing</b>: [Before prototyping] Validate my positioning on the problem.  Do players want a separate auction house app?  Do players find value or disvalue of having a new auction platform?</li>

                  <li><b>Usability testing</b>: [Throughout prototyping] Ensure design process is on the right track, tackling the right pain points, creating the most efficiency and intuitiveness for the user.</li>



                  <li><b>Metric and Analytics</b>: [After implementation] Identifying KPIs and metrics to track before and after implemention.  Tracking these indicators will allow the designers to recognize points of success and points to improve.  For example, metrics may include average user clicks to reach goal in the auction house, number of complaints and support issues filed for the auction house, speed of item processing in the auction house, server speed of the auction house, etc.</li>


                  </ul>


                  <div class="subheader">Takeaways and Future Thoughts</div>

                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li>Unfortunately, given the time and resource constraints, I was not able to delve as deep as I wanted to in mockups.  However, I believe research proved more valuable in this situation.  Given more time, I would love to further hash out the remaining screens.</li>
                  <li>For future iterations, I would like to explore more of the logic behind Blizzard's current Auction House system, collaborating with WoW's game team, as well as the mobile design team.  I believe the haziness of the scope, as aforementioned, is a big constraint.</li>
                  <li>With more time, I would also like to better explore and understand possible edge cases of users.</li>
                    <li>To expand on this project, I would also love to gain more insight on the "whys" behind the feature, as well as the numbers and research that may currently exist for similar features (for example, how often users currently share links to social sites outside of Roblox).  Similarly,
                    it would be very important to iterate and collaborate with existing UX designers on the Roblox team.</li>
                  <li>An important takeaway of this assignment was the value of research.  Jumping straight into the assignment, I felt lost and overwhelmed by a product I was not extremely familiar with.  However, with some time Googling and using the product, I began to better understand not only the product itself, but also the community of the product, which was critical to this assignment.</li>
                  <li>My initial thoughts entering the assignment was the sheer complexity of the problem.  World of Warcraft is a complex game with many years of changes and updates.  There is a certain level of depth of understanding that may need to be reached before being able to properly design for this type of game.  My takeaway is the value of breaking down the problem into smaller pieces.  What exactly is Blizzard asking for - improved flow and modernized experience.  What are the features of the existing platforms - mobile, web, in-game. </li>
                  </ul>
