            <h5> context </h5>
            This project idea began when I adopted a dog that was not potty trained.  I faced problems such as timing walking and feeding, and coordinating schedules.  I decided to create an app concept that would smartly tackle these issues.

                <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">context</span></h4>

                Anyone who has owned a puppy or untrained dog has gone through the terrifying stage of potty training. Figuring out when to feed your dog, how much to feed them, how often to feed them, when to walk them, how often to walk them — there’s so much! Each dog is different, and there is no set schedule that works for every situation.
                <br/><br/>
                The problem becomes even more complicated when there are multiple owners taking care of the same dog, which is often the case. This requires some simple way of communicating to the other party or parties when the dog has been walked, when it’s last accident was, etc.
                <br/><br/>
                Having gone through this experience recently, I decided to draft up some ideas for a solution.


                <div class="subheader">The Problem (Hypothesis)</div>


                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li>Dog owners who are in the process of potty training their dogs want to be able to predict and schedule when they shoudl feed and walk their dogs.</li>
                  <li>Dog owners who co-own one dog want to coordinate and sync their schedules and easily see if the dog has been walked or fed.</li>
                </ul>




                <div class="subheader">Goals</div>


                <ul class="takeaways">
                <li>Build an intuitive tracking experience that allows users to easily input information</li>
                <li>Alert and inform users when a dog needs to be walked or fed</li>
                <li>Display statistics and information about historical trends and future extrapolations</li>
                <li>Build a social system for multiple users to share one dog, with all information synced across users</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="blockquote"><b>Goal:</b> Design an app to make the process of potty training dogs easier, through a clean interface, tracking functionalities, and algorithmic core.</div>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div data-aos="fade-up" >

              <div class="number">02</div>

              <div class="container-dark">

                <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">my role</span></h4>
                As this was a personal project, I had to opportunity to go as in-depth as I desired and explore skills I have previously not explored.

                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li><b>Design</b>: create user personas to understand target audience, conduct affinity mapping to develop information architecture, user needs, and product features, create mind maps, design branding such as logos, fonts, colors, create low to high fidelity wireframes, create clickable prototype, practice agile iterations</li>
                  <li><b>Product</b>: conduct market research, understand competition and target audience, develop value propositions, make product decisions and product roadmap direction decisions</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

                <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">research</span></h4>

                <div class="subheader">User Interviews</div>

                By identifying target users and interviewing actual dog owners who have gone through the process of training dogs, I came up with a few summary points:<br/>

                <ul class="takeaways">
                <li>Users desire an easy input of data, quick tap to indicate “fed”, and options to add more detailed data for those who wish to track with more data</li>
                <li>Detailed data may include amount fed, amount of water given, type of food (canned food, kibble, etc.)</li>
                <li>Beyond entering the information, the user should not have to do anything, and the app will calculate and predict feeding and walking cycles</li>
                <li>The more days entered, the more accurate. Users using this app will likely need fast turnaround, so perfecting the algorithm so it is accurate within the first 3 or 4 days of data would be ideal</li>
                <li>May need the feature of multiple dogs with multiple caretakers
                Creating user personas and walking through the various use cases.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="blockquote"><b>Target Audience:</b> Dog-owners, both experienced and first-timers.</div>

                <div class="subheader">User Personas</div>

                Next, I decided to create a few common, in-depth user personas to walk through the use cases:<br/>

                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li><b>Eileen</b> is a 20 year old college student who is a first time dog owner. She adopted a puppy on a whim at the local shelter, and has come across many obstacles in training the puppy, alongside her busy class schedule. She did not anticipate the time and energy it would take to potty train this new puppy. She is in need of a more pragmatic solution to understanding how to align her puppy’s schedule with her own.</li>

                  <li><b>Rachel</b> is a 40 year old working professional and dog enthusiast. She has several kids, a working husband, two large dogs, and a busy lifestyle. Her family just decided to adopt a new rescue dog, who has never been properly potty trained. Rachel does not have the ability to stay at home and watch over the dog, which is the typical method of potty training. Without a fast way to train the dog, she is only able to keep the dog outdoors for long periods of time or come home after work to accidents all over the house. She is looking for a solution to train her new dog faster, without much extra effort on her end.</li>

                  <li><b>Lucy</b> is a 15 year old high school student who runs her own dog sitting and dog training business. She offers services such as taking care of dogs while the owners are away, as well as taking puppies and new rescue dogs for a couple weeks to train for a busy owner. It is typically difficult for Lucy to instill potty training techniques on the dogs over such a short period of time. She is looking for something that will help expedite the training process, so she can complete potty training in a set amount of days for customers, and build a more competitive business.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="subheader">Key takeaways from user research</div>
                <ul class="takeaways">
                <li>With a very targeted user base, how will this app grow? In addition, once people are done potty training a new dog, the application will likely be not needed anymore. How can I make it consistently add value to the user’s life?</li>
                <li>Focusing on just potty training tracking, or also expanding to walking and exercise tracking? This may be of use to families or people sharing a dog with varied schedules, for each individual to easily view when the dog was last walked and for how long. Would this detract focus from the main use of the app?</li>
              </ul>

              <div class="subheader">Market Research</div>
              I decided to continue my research by researching current competitive services in the same market.  This allows me to better understand not only who the potential competitors are, but also the market environment, as well as what customers are or are not happy with in the current existing services.

              <ul class="takeaways">
              <li><b><a href="http://www.puddleandpile.com/" target="_blank">Puddle & Pile</a> (iOS and Android app — $1.99)</b>:

              App solely focused on tracking and learning a dog’s toilet behavior, promising no guesswork after a few days of data. The concept is well thought out, but the user experience is lacking and not very intuitive. Critical reviews include difficult to edit/read past inputs, no option to track more than one dog, and the inability for multiple users to access the same dog data.</li>

              <li><b><a href="http://www.pawtracksapp.com/" target="_blank">Paw Tracks</a> (iOS app — Free)</b>:

              Focuses on the aspect of logging using the bathroom while walking, length of walks, time of walks, and who took the walk. The app allows multiple dogs and multiple users to share a dog. Primary use is not for toilet training a dog, but rather for syncing with multiple users on when the dog has walked and pooped/peed. Negative reviews include buggy data after multiple uses,user interface problems, lack of data visualizations, and constant server errors.</li>

              <li><b><a href="http://www.poopeepuppy.com/" target="_blank">PooPee Puppy</a> (iOS app — Discontinued)</b>:

              This app received a good amount of attention while it was out, but now it is currently under construction, with no date of returning. It features a three button interface for entering when the dog has peed, pooped, or had an accident. Beyond that, you can view the dog’s progress and receive notifications when the dog is expected to need to use the bathroom again.</li>

            </ul>
              </div>

            </div>

            <div data-aos="fade-up" >
              <div class="number">04</div>
              <div class="container-dark">

                <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">value prop</span></h4>

                By gathering market data and overlaying that with the purpose and context of creating this app, I was able to gather some important points that make Pawtty more valuable or unique in its offerings:

                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li>Manual input of data, similar to the competitor apps, but Pawtty will feature an algorithmic core that takes this user inputed data and extrapolate, predict, and learn based off of the patterns</li>
                  <li>Competitor apps typically only tackle one of the two major problems - potty training or synchronized schedules for multiple owners; Pawtty will solve both in one go</li>
                  <li>Pawtty will allow users to own and manage multiple dogs</li>
                  <li>Pawtty will provide an easy "share" platform for co-owners to notify each other of a walk, a bathroom break, or things like a change in their schedule</li>
                </ul>

              </div>

            </div>

                  At the starting point of this project, I was not familiar with iOS HCI guidelines.  Many of my design decisions were based as if the project were a web application.  Round edges were inconsistent, text inputs were not standardized, and navigation was not mobile-first.  I took time to familiarize myself and learn the HCI guidelines before designing Version 2, which features more consistency and mobile-first thinking.

                  As this was the first time I had conducted such in-depth market research prior to building the product, I was able to learn just how valuable market research and analysis is.  Not only does it provide information on the competitors and the market environment, it also allows a more direct understanding of the target audience and their demands.  <br/><br/>



                  Mistakes I made included not fully understanding the Apple iOS interface design standards the first time around.  Though I created a visually pleasing design, I did not take into account the regulations and standards of iOS design principles.  I found it very valuable and fulfilling to revisit this project after gaining more knowledge and practice with HCI design standards.  I believe in growth and constant self-reflection, and I'm looking forward to looking back on this project in a few months or years and reiterating on my skills once again.
