                <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">context</span></h4>

                This redesign was created as part of my application to the KPCB Design Fellows.

                <div class="blockquote"><b>Goal:</b> Redesign a feature of DoorDash to improve intuitiveness and user experience.</div>


                Taking on this project, I was very excited to get to know DoorDash better.  Food delivery is a huge guilty pleasure of mine, and I love seeing the surge in competitors and trying out the different services.  Though I've had experiences with UberEats, Favor, and Postmates, I was excited to try out DoorDash for this assignment.  This allows me to have a fair comparison with other services, while maintaining a fresh view of DoorDash.<br/><br/>

                I will be focusing on redesigning and improving <b>user experience</b> throughout the <b>web application</b>.  As DoorDash is already an extremely well-designed service with engineers, designers, product managers, etc. working full time to create and improve the product, I opted against creation of new features or drastic changes in the design or product.  I wanted to focus, instead, on improving existing features, from a fresh perspective, while undergoing the user research process.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div data-aos="fade-up" >

              <div class="number">02</div>

              <div class="container-dark">

                <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">my role</span></h4>
                As this was a personal project, I had to opportunity to go as in-depth as I desired and explore skills I have previously not explored.

                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li><b>Design</b>: create user personas to understand target audience, create affinity maps to develop information architecture, user needs, and product features, create mind maps</li>
                  <li><b>Product</b>: conduct market research, understand competition and target audience, develop value propositions</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

            </div>

            <div data-aos="fade-up" >
              <div class="number">03</div>

              <div class="container-dark">

                <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">research</span></h4>

                <div class="subheader">User Research</div>

                My first step was to gain some more background on the users of DoorDash and other food delivery services.  This insight allows me to better understand what type of people use the app, what type of people should be targeted, and what direction the app can grow towards.

                <ul class="takeaways">
                <li>In a 2015 survey, 44% of respondents stated that they would be more likely to order delivery if restaurants could guarantee faster delivery speeds</li>
                <li>In the same 2015 survey, 27% of respondents stated they would pay more for faster delivery speeds</li>
                <li>In a different 2015 survey, 48% of respondents order food delivery because it is more practical, 31% do so because they are unable to go to the restaurant, and 13% do not have the time to cook.</li>
                <li>Most respondents order for dinner (56%) rather than lunch (35%).</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="blockquote"><b>Key Audience</b>: People who are very conscious of delivery speed and ease of use</div>

                <div class="subheader">Initial Observations</div>


              <b>What DoorDash does well:</b>

                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li><b>Simplicity</b>: The design is not overwhelming with few action items, and the majority of the page focused on search. </li>

                  <li><b>Drop Downs</b>: The structure of the drop-down options (Address, When, Account, Your Order) save space until needed for use. In particular, the delivery date selection feels very intuitive - well placed, easy to see, easy to use.</li>

                  <li><b>Attractive Visuals</b>: Simple icons, subtle animations (the adorable eye in the magnifying glass!), clean interaction movements.</li>

                  <li><b>Food Selection Details</b>: The option to add items that people also paired with your food selection is an excellent ueser experience.  Similarly, the option to select what to do if an issue arises is very intuitive.</li>

                  <li><b>Group Order</b>: Group ordering is unique to DoorDash, and my impression of it is very good.  It's built in smoothly with simple, straightforward options.

                  <li><b>Split Screen View of Order</b>: I particularly like this design decision, as it uses all available screen real estate without feeling cluttered or excessive. </li>
                </ul>

                <b>What DoorDash lacks:</b>

                  <ul class="takeaways">
                    <li><b>Filtering</b>: The only search available on DoorDash's home page - both mobile and web - is basic keyword search or filter by pre-given food types (ie. Trending food types).  Intuitively, I want to sort by price of food (e.g. dollar signs on Yelp), sort by speed of delivery (in some cases, reliant on proximity of restaurant), or sort by delivery cost.</li>



                    <li><b>Ratings</b>: At first use, I wasn't even aware DoorDash had a ratings feature, as there is no sign of it on the overview search page.  Once you click on a specific restaurant, there seems to be a "Delight" score as well as the number of ratings beside it.  There is ambiguity on what this rating really means, and there is the inability to view and sort by it.</li>

                    <li><b>Search Limitations</b>: Current search appears to be limited to only restaurant names and cuisine type.  What if I want to see all places that have biryani?  In addition, the selection of icons does not feel intuitive, with the selection appearing in the search bar (goes from icon to text).</li>

                      <li><b>Grid Design</b>: Though the grid design allows the user to quickly scroll through selections, the infinite scroll makes it feel endless and incomplete.  In addition, there feels like there is a disconnect once the user clicks on a particular restaurant page, as there are no built-in options to go back or search again. </li>

                  </ul>




              </div>

            </div>

            <div data-aos="fade-up" >
              <div class="number">04</div>
              <div class="container-dark">

                <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">value prop</span></h4>

              DoorDash's existing success makes this redesign challenge even harder of a challenge.  I believe there is still value that can be brought to the table, despite that fact.  For example:
              <ul class="takeaways">
                <li><b>More power to the user</b>: Allowing the user to filter in more ways and find exactly what they are looking for will encourage user retention.</li>
                <li><b>Clearer flow</b>: Clarification of some of the user experience elements will allow users to more clearly navigate the application.</li>
              </ul>

              </div>

            </div>

            <div data-aos="fade-up" >
              <div class="number">05</div>
              <div class="container-dark">

                <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">process</span></h4>

                <div class="subheader">Brainstorming</div>

                <div class="subheader">low fidelity sketches</div>

              <img src="doordash/001-sketch.jpg" width="80%"><br/><br/>

              <div class="caption"><span>Low Fidelity  Sketch of Landing Page & Detail Page</span></div>

              <div class="container-dark">

                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li><b>1. Search</b>: This new setup allows the user to quick-select three sort options.  These options are single-select rather than multi-select.  With three simple, universal icons, users are able to sort by price (low to high), delivery speed (low to high), or delight rating (high to low).<br/><br/>
                  In addition, users can click the down arrow to display more advanced filtering options.  In this dropdown menu, users can stack these sort variables as well as multi-select prices and select ranges of delivery speed and ratings.<br/><br/>
                With this search, I also hope to expand the functionalities to keyword search foods, in addition to cuisine type and restaurant name.  I also believe suggestions and auto-complete will be useful in pushing these changes.  For example, someone may begin searching for "orange" and see "orange chicken" as a suggested search, thus realizing that they can search by food.</li>
                  <li><b>2. Cuisine Select</b>: As mentioned previously, it is unclear what happens when the user selects one of the cuisine options.  There is no visual indicator on the circle icons.  In this case, it will be shown as "selected" with a shaded icon and white check mark.  This also allows the user to select multiple cuisine options (other than View All, which is single-select).  For example, if the user is feeling either Italian or Chinese food, they can simply select both icons.</li>
                  <li><b>3. Restaurant Grid</b>: The restaurant display grid now will show more information, more easily readable.  It will have 3 "columns", similar to a booklet - the restaurant logo/image, the name and cuisine type, and finally, a clarifying bar that displays the sort information (price, delivery speed, and delight rating).</li>

                  <li><b>Detail Page</b>: I didn't change much, other than include the new search bar, as well as the option to "return to results".  I believe this allows the flow to be more connected, and not feel like you have to go very far back to be able to search again.
                  </ul>

                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li><b>The value of multiple iterations</b>: With this redesign project being on much of a time crunch, with limited background information and data to work off of, the iteration process has also been limited.  Typically, I'd like to go back and forth and bounce ideas back and forth with peers or co-workers to create better and better iterations each time.  With this project, many elements only underwent one design iteration.  In this case, "done is better than perfect" applies, but in the future, I would love to return to this and try out more versions.</li>
                  <li><b>The <i>why</i> behind a redesign</b>: While doing any redesign, I'm always reminded of going back to the <i>why</i>.  It's easy to be caught up in the visual aspects, making the design look better, feel better; however, we forget the why - why is this feature being redesigned, why is it necessary or advantagous for the company to add this feature?  In this case, I hope to emphasize the why is because I want to make the application <b>more accessible, more powerful, and clearer</b>.</li>
                    <li><b>Next steps</b>: If given the opportunity, I would love to expand on this project by, not only creating more iterations, but also conduct usability testing to determine the effect that this type of redesign would have on the product.  Perhaps usability testing or A/B testing would provide good insight.
