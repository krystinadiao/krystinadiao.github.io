            <h5> context </h5>
            I wanted to practice my hand at my first redesign project of an existing product, and since I am a big League of Legends fan, I decided to tackle their mobile application.
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h5>my role</h5>
            Being a personal redesign project, I was able to take full control and delve into user research and learn more about the different components that go into a product redesign.

              <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">context</span></h4>

              As a League of Legends fan who has been playing since Season 2 (yet somehow still can’t get past Silver), I have had the opportunity to see the many changes, big and small, that the game has undergone in the past 4 years. The changes that the client and game interface have undergone in the past year are incredible, to say the least. From an outside perspective, Riot has definitely been placing more emphasis on design — from updating outdated champion splash arts and redesigning the game client user experience to rethinking the draft pick champion select process and updating the overall visual “look”.

              <section class="regular slider">
                <div>
                  <img src="leaguemobile/001-oldclient.png"/>
                </div>
              </section>
              <div class="caption"><span>Throwback to the old client</span></div>

              As a regular player of the game and an aspiring designer, I naturally began to think about the limitations of the current game client and what could be improved on. Though the most recent updates in design already impressed me, primarily in visual design and animation, I thought there were still a few points that could be improve upon.<br/><br/>

              When I began contemplating this challenge, I actually had a lot of update ideas in mind for the current client. I wanted to focus on functionality and flow issues, rather than aesthetic and visual updates. Some primary ideas included:



              <ul class="takeaways">
                <li>Reorganizing the store — making it more intuitive to navigate</li>
                <li>The opportunity to unlock skins in champion select</li>
                <li>Improving chat, friend, and club flow — making it friendlier with tooltip updates</li>
                <li>In-game settings available for change on the client for users that want to tinker with these settings without actually launching a game, or taking time from a live game</li>
                <li>Allowing customization of content displayed on the home page (esports, content creators, analytics — champion, game statistics)</li>
              </ul>

              Given all this, I suddenly came across the ongoing alpha client updates. I’m surprised I hadn’t seen this alpha earlier, but once I saw it, I was left speechless. All I can say is, kudos to the designers, and Riot is on the right track, and making continuous, intuitive, aesthetic changes. I am impressed with the investment Riot is making in design.<br/><br/>

              Since Riot’s design team is already tackling design on their own, I decided to pour my efforts in considering the mobile potential of League.
              <br/><br/>
              TLDR: Wanted to do redesign study on the League client, but Riot is ahead of the game and already working on amazing things, so instead, going to do redesign study on the League mobile app!


              <div class="blockquote"><b>Goal:</b> Update the mobile experience of the League of Legend's mobile app to include the demands of the fans, as well as increase experience flow and intuitiveness.</div>

            </div>
          </div>



          <div data-aos="fade-up" >

            <div class="number">02</div>

            <div class="container-dark">

              <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">my role</span></h4>

            This was one of my first redesign projects, allowing me to practice making suggestions to an existing product, rather than building one from the ground up. <br/><br/>
             This project was less about visual design, and more about user research, user experience design, and product thinking - determining which features were valuable, which existing features needed adjustments.

              <div class="subheader">current analysis</div>

              The League of Legends mobile app was released in <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/download-free-league-friends-mobile-app" target="_blank">February 2016</a>. It currently is a simple platform to view, add, and chat with friends and clubs.
              <section class="regular slider">
                <div>
                  <img src="leaguemobile/002-currentapp.png"/>
                </div>
              </section>
              <div class="caption"><span>The current mobile app — “LoL Friends”</span></div>

              I believe the mobile app has huge, untouched potential. League has over 100 million active monthly players, yet only 1 million to 5 million downloads of the app on the Android Play Store. Though the iOS statistics aren’t available, assuming it’s a total of 10 million downloads in total, the app reach is still insignificant compared to the total user base of the game. I think Riot has the potential to leverage it’s huge following and create a mobile platform that offers benefits to all users.

              <div class="subheader">problems</div>
              <ul class="takeaways">
                <li>At a glance view of which recently chatted with friends are online</li>
                <li>Functionality beyond just chatting, while maintaining simplicity and social core</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">value prop</span></h4>

              <div class="subheader">key implementations</div>
              I took to the League boards and Play Store/App Store reviews to gather some data on what the users think, on top of my existing ideas. User feedback is key, and I’m certain Riot already has a good idea of the features that players are interested in.
              <ul class="takeaways">
                <li><b>Chat</b>: increasing ease of use</li>
                <li><b>Search</b>: searching for players</li>
                <li><b>Store</b>: purchasing/gifting RP, characters, skins, etc.</li>
                <li><b>Profile</b>: updating summoner icon and status, customizing the splash art present on your profile, viewing simplified match history</li>
                <li><b>Mini-game</b>: creating a simple mini-game for users to play, solely on the mobile app, with the opportunity to earn small amounts of IP</li>
              </ul>

            </div>

          </div>

          <div data-aos="fade-up" >

              <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">process</span></h4>


              Things to keep in mind during the design process:
              <ul class="takeaways">
                <li>Keeping the app as simple as possible while still reaching the desired functionalities. It’s clear that Riot’s primary purpose in creating this app is for a lightweight, social platform. So the goal is to find the balance between implementing the features users want while maintaining the simplicity.</li>
                <li>Maintaining the integrity of the current design and functionalities, as well as the following the trends of the League-sphere overall. Ensuring the all functionalities and designs are not out of place for both players and creators of League.</li>
                <li>Designing with purpose, rather than just a visual update. I would like to focus on showing design process, design thinking, and user/functionality ideas. For this purpose, I will only be creating medium fidelity wireframes to show my ideas clearly, rather than trying to recreating existing designs and making very high fidelity mockups.</li>
              </ul>

              <div class="caption"><span>New chat</span></div>


              <ul class="takeaways">
                <li>At-a-glance view to see if someone is online (green), on mobile (gray phone), in game (blue), away (red), or offline (white). Clearer view on which messages are unread vs. read. This information is already available on the “friends list” page, so why not make it available on the main chat screen as well? This allows users to quickly see if a friend is online to chat or play, cutting out the extra step of viewing the friends list.</li>
              <li>  New “edit” option, similar to iOS Messages, to handle multiple messages at once. Default actions, before selecting chats, are to “read all” or “delete all”. After selection, it changes to “read” or “delete”. This feature is primarily useful for those who may get a lot of spam or random messages, or anyone who wants to quickly manage their chats.</li>
              <li>  Thoughts: should the availability status be on the left of the name instead of the right, to follow the existing design on the “friend list” page?</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="caption"><span>New profile edit options</span></div>

                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li>The new profile view has two tabs — Profile and Match History</li>
              <li>Profile is pretty much the same, a bigger emphasis on Dynamic (the most played and popular one of the three) and icons of the user’s most played champions (from all game data, normals and ranked)</li>
              <li>Showing the most played champions gives the user’s profile more uniqueness and allows friends to see what type of player his/her friend is</li>
              <li>Match history is similar to the one in game, but more consolidated and at-a-glance view; details are not available on mobile to keep it lightweight and simple</li>
              <li>New profile view also allows customization of your summoner icon and the splash art that appears as a background in your profile — this splash art is currently random</li>
              <li>I believe allowing the customization of the splash art gives each user a sense of identification with his or her profile
              The allowed splash arts would be champions and skins that the individual owns</li>
              </ul>

              <div class="subheader">search</div>

              The introduction of search is a little more complicated than just adding features to the chat. The current flow of “adding” (tapping the large plus sign), which leads to the option of adding a friend to chat or creating a new group chat, is a bit confusing.<br/><br/>
              A user does not always know the precise summoner name of their friend. For example, I may know my friend’s name starts with “scar-” but can’t remember the rest. Like a google search, it would be very useful to have some kind of autofill feature rather than guessing.

              <ul class="takeaways">
                <li>Adding a search function to find friends, view streamer/pro profiles</li>

              <div class="subheader">store</div>
              A highly sought after feature of the app, according to players, is the ability to make the same transactions as the ones available on the game client. This includes buying RP, using IP/RP to buy skins, champions, accessories, etc., and gifting. The first step I took was to see what all is available on the full game client and which of these elements are necessary to include in the mobile app. Since the mobile platform is much smaller, and should be much simpler, it’s important to keep only what is useful.

                  <img src="leaguemobile/018-store.png"/>
                </div>

              </section>
              <div class="caption"><span>New store</span></div>

              I went back and forth several times about including a hamburger menu for the store, but I ultimately decided to go with it due to the large number of subcategories necessary to include to create a familiar experience, relative to the game client

              <div class="subheader">mini-game</div>
              <ul class="takeaways">
                <li>The idea of a mini-game has a lot of potential, but I believe this feature is better suited to be laid out by someone with game development/creation experience. I will not be designing the wireframe for this section due to the haziness of the idea and structure overall, but I will be panning out a few ideas that I think could be expanded upon.</li>
                <li>Basically, I think a mini-game would create more incentive for people to use this mobile app, while also adding a new twist to the game overall. Players who may not see League as a primarily social outlet may find less use out of a chat-based app.</li>
                <li>This mini-game could be something simple, played to pass time (on the bus, in line, in between class, etc.), but still require a bit of strategy to appeal to the general League player (for example, poro pinball?).</li>
                <li>Having a 1 player option alongside a 2 player + option would give people the option to play themselves or play against a friend. </li>
                <li>Small amounts of IP could be rewarded for playing this game. Playing versus a friend, or multiple friends, would reward more IP. Maybe there could be an element of gambling your IP, with caps of course.</li>
                <li>For example, if 3 friends see each other on the mobile app, but none of them are at a computer, they can choose to start a mini-game together. They decide on a wager amount, each person chips in that amount (say, 25 IP). This amount is deducted from each player’s IP pool, and after completing the game, whoever wins gets all 75 IP.</li>
                <li>I think there would need to be a cap or limitation on how often this game could be played, whether it’s daily plays or recharge lives. The mini-game should not detract from earning IP the traditional way, through full games.</li>
                <li>Problems to consider may include — would this create an unfair advantage for players with Android/Apple games? There are many users already generating complaints about the app not being available for Windows phones, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="subheader">Future iterations/implementations</div>
                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li>
                    <b>Spectating</b> is one of the most highly demanded features. I believe, design wise, this would not be a difficult implementation, but functionally may prove as a challenge. Spectating a friend’s game would require some kind of link from the mobile device to the live game data, which can get very heavy and slow. Spectating LCS or other competitive games would overlap on the streams already available on YouTube, Twitch, Azubu, etc. Perhaps simply embedding a YouTube “featured video” when the games are live would be an easier alternative.</li>
                      <li><b>Standardizing</b> design elements and experience with the game client. For example, I used a shopping cart icon as a placeholder for the “shopping” page, but in reality I would want to use the treasure chest & coins icon like in the client. Similarly, I may want to change the “most played champions” to champion mastery, to unify the experience from game client to mobile.</li>
                    <li>  Incorporating <b>special events</b> on the mobile app. For example, the Teemoing is going on right now, so maybe including somewhere in the store that links to “specials”, including allowing unlocking the user’s findings from the Teemoing shop would be convenient.</li>

              <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">results & takeaways</span></h4>

                I had to opportunity to speak with a UX Designer at Riot Games to review my redesign.  She provided strong insight on points that I previously did not consider.  <br/><br/>

               Some points of this project that I would like to highlight:

               <ul class="takeaways">
                 <li>The Rioter noted the importance of determining why certain features were deliberately not included.  It is valuable to contemplate these decisions and determine what value adding these features truly brings to not only the app, the fans, but also the company.  Finally, it is important to create compelling arguments of why certain features are still suggested to be included, and what value they bring to different components (the engineers at Riot, the designers at Riot, the PMs at Riot, the fans, the gameplay experience, etc.)</li>

                 <li>To expand on this project, I would like to conduct further user testing, beyond just surveying the forums.  For example, a usability testing of a prototype with the new features, or a user interview targetting different user groups.</li>

                 <li>Even just walking through the process of thinking about how to create a more useful, intuitive mobile app has allowed me to better understand design thinking and user thinking.  I have also learned to recognize the value of creating fast, medium-fidelity wireframes, rather than spending time to create high-fidelity designs.  This allows faster iteration of a wide-scale project, as well as the ability to view the project at a higher level.</li>
