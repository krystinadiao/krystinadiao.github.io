          This project was my primary project at Bazaarvoice during the summer of 2016.  My task was to analyze the effectiveness of a newly implemented knowledge base.  The product at hand, Connections, had previously no knowledge base and very brief documentation.  Thus, the purpose of the project was to quantitatively depict the necessity of product knowledge documentation and it's direct effect on support.

          <br/><br/>

          I created two final pages.  The first one details the data, while the second one is an executive summary for higher level executives to view and present with ease.<br/>

            This project presented itself as a more research based project.  I wanted to grasp the opportunity at a large software company to submerge myself in more development-based projects, thus I created a developmental edge for myself.  I decided to create the end analytics with JavaScript data visualizations, rather than mundane pivot tables or other graphing tools.  <Br/><br/>
            With little to no prior knowledge in JavaScript, I learned many things on the job, along with the assistance and mentorship of those around me.  I ultimately created my visualizations with D3 and C3 libraries.
