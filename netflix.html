            <h5> context </h5>
          In this project, I design a new concept feature for Netflix to improve the interaction between Netflix users.  Though Netflix-ing can be social as much as it can be independent, there lacks social aspects bringing users together who are not physically together.

                <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">context</span></h4>

              In this design challenge, I make the interaction between Netflix users more meaningful.  I learn the value of user surveys, realigning my problem statement to based on research, and the value of existing UI kits.

              <div class="subheader">The Problem (Hypothesis)</div>


              <ul class="takeaways">

                <li>Though Netflix has "profiles" for users under each account, there is no interaction between the users.</li>
                <li>Netflix can be very much of an independent activity or a social activity, but there lacks social aspects within the app.</li>
              </ul>

                This allowed me to focus on user research, user experience, interaction design, and problem solving, rather than building style guides and UI kits.

                <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">research</span></h4>

                <div class="subheader">User Interviews</div>
                I began my research process by identifying
                users and developing and conducting an interview.  I was able to reach out to rather diverse groups of users, but time constraints limited the users I actually received responses from.  Responses were collected from 22 people.

              <br/><br/>
              A snippet of questions I asked:


                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li>How many hours, on average, do you spend watching Netflix per week?</li>
                  <li>How many of those hours are spent watching alone (rather than with other people)?</li>

                <li>Do you ever watch the same shows with a non-local friend?</li>

                <li>How often do you talk with your friends or family about new shows you've been watching?</li>

                <li>What are you favorite features of Netflix?  What are your least favorite?</li>
                </ul>



                <div class="subheader">User Personas</div>

                Next, I decided to create a user personas to showcase a few primary use cases:<br/><br/>

<img src="netflix/personas.png" width="100%">




                <div class="subheader">Key takeaways from user research</div>

Though I embarked on the project with a good idea of what I wanted to design, feature-wise, the interviews and personas helped navigate me in a clearer and better direction.  The interviews gave me clearer, real-user insight on what users like and dislike from Netflix.  It was important to not ask the users "what do you want", as users are typically unable to clearly identify what that may be, but rather form questions around what they like and don't like.
                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li>A large majority of users interviewed watch shows with friends at some point in the week</li>

                <li>The watching experience is only social when users are physically next to each other, watching, but what happens for people who want to watch together but are separated by distance?</li>
              </ul>



            </div>

            <div data-aos="fade-up" >
              <div class="number">04</div>
              <div class="container-dark">

                <h4>  <span class="hello-dark">value prop</span></h4>

                After gathering the user research and drawing some insights, I decided on two primary features: <b>"watch together" and the companion app</b>.

                <div class="subheader">"Watch Together" Feature Details</div>

With "Watch Together", users are able to share a unique URL with their friends to simultaneously watch a show.  The video is synced across all screens - when one user pauses, the video pauses for everybody, and the same goes for play and skip ahead.  Users can make comments and "react" to what's going on, but this section is very temporary and fades away to prevent permanent screen real estate usage.

<div class="subheader">Companion App Details</div>

Since Netflix is very much cross platform, I needed to think about how "Watch Together" would be intertwined with laptop, tablet, smartphone, and TV (smart TV, game consoles, etc.).  I decided a lightweight companion app would be perfect for bringing together all of the platforms.

      <div class="subheader">Market Research</div>

<div class="bigimg">
      <section class="threescreens slider">
        <div>
          <img src="netflix/watch2gether.png"/>

          <img src="netflix/rabbit.png"/>
        </div>
      </section>

</div>
<div class="container-dark">

Watch2gether, MyCircle.TV, and Rabbit were three services that I found while conducting my research.  These three services are all quite similar, allowing users to create a "room" and essentially screen share from that unique URL room.  Problems I discovered while using these features was the large amount of screen real estate given up to chat and other features.  In addition, the quality of the videos is drastically decreased as users are essentially watching a screen share from one user (think Skype and Google Hangouts).  Finally, users sharing content, especially from subscription services like Netflix (which is only available on Rabbit), may cause issues of infringing on copyrighted videos.  In other words, users are able to watch their friends' Netflix without having a subscription themselves.

<br/><br/>

The next two services I found align much more closely with "Watch Together".

<div class="bigimg">
      <section class="twoscreens slider">
        <div>
          <img src="netflix/netflixparty2.png"/>

        <div>
          <img src="netflix/showgoer2.png"/>
        </div>
      </section>


</div>
<div class="container-dark">

Netflix Party and Showgoer are both Chrome extensions that allow users to watch videos together straight from Netflix.  These differ from the aforementioned services as they require all parties to have a Netflix subscription, and the process takes place within the Netflix app.<br/><br/>
Some problems I identified from these two apps is the necessity of a third party app and extension and the screen real estate taken up by chat.  The third party app limits the watching to desktop and only on Chrome.  A huge part of Netflix is it's on-the-go ability on tablets and smartphones.  I believe an internal Netflix app can be designed much more elegantly and intuitively.



                <div class="subheader">Business Objective</div>

It was important to me throughout this design process to keep in mind: <b>How does Netflix benefit from these features?</b>. <br/><br/> Though it's valuable to keep the customers happy, and these features solve certain pain points the customers have, what drives Netflix to spend large amounts of money designing and buliding out this feature?<br/><br/>
Netflix's main revenue drive is the tiered subscription structure.  Users are encouraged to upgrade from 1 to 2 to 4 active screens, each at a different price point.  <br/><br/>
These feature suggestions boost user interaction within the Netflix community.  Users are able to watch shows together, on their own separate accounts.  Thus, this doesn't affect screen upgrades.  More people watching, watching together, creates a sense of community and serves as a unique competitive feature.
<ul class="takeaways">
  <li>  The features foster a community that encourages existing users to stay subscribed and watch with friends.  </li>
  <li>The features encourage potential users to join in order to watch with friends.</li>
</ul>

These first few sketches lay out the process of "Watch Together", and how the companion app ties all the communication together.  The second set of images shows the placement of chat and reactions on the main watching screen.  <br/>

<br/>
Users will be able to either type and react directly on the screen, if watching via mobile, tablet, or laptop, or have the option to type and react on the companion app.  The text and reactions will appear briefly on the upper right hand corner, before fading away.  If hovered, it will reappear.  There is an option to toggle it's appearance on the big screen on and off.
                <div class="subheader">User Testing</div>


  Before moving forward to medium and high fidelity iterations, I wanted to have some user testing to back up my design decisions and ensure that I was moving in the right direction.  The primary points I wanted to learn more about were:

  <ul class="takeaways">
    <li>Do users want messages and reactions to show up on the main screen, or will that be too detracting and invaluable of a feature?</li>
    <li>What is the cost of users having to install a new, separate companion app?  Will users be willing to go out of their way to download and use this application?</li>
  </ul>

  After gathering more survey results,  I made some important decisions before moving foward.  The companion app would remain a component, but an optional component.  It will also be important to have options available for message and reaction displays, as well as other components to the feature.



  <div class="subheader">Task Flow</div>

<b>Watching on TV:</b> User opens Netflix on TV and wants to watch with a few friends. He opens the companion app to generate the URL and share it with his friends <b> or </b> his friend sends him a URL, and he opens it on his mobile device, which subsequently opens the companion app, sending a command to the active Netflix device (his TV) to join that watching group.  He watches on his TV and is able to chat and react on the companion app.  He has options to turn on or off the chat/reactions from showing up on the TV via his phone.
<br/><br/>

<b>Watching on Laptop or Tablet:</b> User opens Netflix on a laptop, desktop, or tablet and wants to watch with a few friends.  He generates the share URL straight in the device <b>or</b> his friend sends him a URL, which he can open on the device.  He watches on his device and is able to chat/react on the device or open the companion app and go from there.  He has options to turn on or off the chat/reactions from showing up on the watching screen via his phone or straight in the device options.

<br/><br/>

<b>Watching on Phone:</b> User opens Netflix on a phone and wants to watch with a few friends.  He generates the share URL straight in the device <b>or</b> his friend sends him a URL, which he can open on the Netflix phone app.  He watches on his device and is able to chat or react - reactions can be made without opening hte keyboard, which is handy for phone watchers.
He has options to turn on or off the chat/reactions from showing up on the watching screen via his phone.



                <div class="subheader">Wireframing</div>

For the purposes of staying concise in this case study, I will be focusing on the desktop/laptop Netflix app + the mobile companion app.
</div>
<div class="bigimg">
<img src="netflix/screens1.png" width="100%">
</div>
<div class="container-dark">

<b>Why names instead of color for easy identification of who's typing?</b> Colors may work in some chat scenarios, allowing a quick glance to see who typed what, without reading the subtext name.  However, in this case, it is important to keep the interface as minimally colored, as gray-scaled as possible.  The main focus is the show playing in the background.

<br/><br/>

<b>What is the significance of allowing the user to turn on and off comments / reactions?</b>  Every viewer has a different viewing experience and viewing expectations.  Some may view the "watch together" feature as simply watching together, and play and pause at the same moments to ensure everyone is watching the same thing.  Some may want to use the chat platform to talk about what's going on or the reactions to quickly react.<br/><br/>

<b>What is the significance of a fading messaging box?</b> Similar to the previous explanation, this adds to the brevity of the message, drawing focus back to the show or movie at hand.  Since users can hover to see the messages again, this gives viewers the freedom to control what they see, when they see it, and how often they see it.
<br/><br/>

<b>Why messages and reactions?</b> Though both add up to the overall experience, they play differing roles.  Messages convey lasting ideas - though the box fades, users can always revisit the box and previous messages.  Reactions are a passing reaction.  Viewers can quickly see what their friends are feeling in reaction to a certain scene, without having to look away from the show or movie to read a comment.

                  <b>Think about the platforms</b>.  This was my first time designing for a product that reaches so widely across so many different platforms.  It was not necessarily visual design that tripped me up on thinking cross-platform, but rather, the numerous different interaction steps I had to consider.  How someone watches Netflix on TV is significantly different from when they watch on their mobile phone.  It was a good exercise to force me to think deeper and wider about the problems. <br/><br/>

                  <b>Think about competitive differences</b>.  What makes this feature or product different from what's already out on the market?  Doing market research was very valuable in this case study, but even more so, utilizing that market research to draw some insights and design decisions.
                  <br/><br/>

                  <div class="subheader">Did I achieve my goal?</div>
                  Going back to stage 1, the goal was to <b>design a social feature that improves interaction between Netflix users</b>.   <br/><br/>

                  Yes.  In this case study and feature design, I created a feature concept that allows Netflix to bring people, who may be far apart physically, closer together via the big screen.
